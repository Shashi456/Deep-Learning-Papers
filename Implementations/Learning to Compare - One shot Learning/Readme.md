# Learning to Compare Few shot Learning 

The code was loosely adopted from this implementation [here](https://github.com/floodsung/LearningToCompare_FSL/blob/master/omniglot/omniglot_train_one_shot.py)

It has been ported to Pytorch 1.0, so the dependencies are now pytorch 1.0 and cuda9.2.

The final accuracy achieved was 97.5% which is similar to what was achieved in the paper. 

TODO : Add diagrams and Explain why the paper works with some intuition.
