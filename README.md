# Papers
- They will either be paper implementations (if rehashed from other source will provide the source and tell you about the modifications i've done) or/and reviews of various papers i will read over time.

- A folder called Implementations is also added, these are implementations which couldn't be added anywhere in the rest of my repository. each implementation will be an folder in itself with a readme etc.
