# Analyzing sentence fusion in Abstractive Summarization
- The paper focuses on analyzing summaries formed by sentence fusion on the basis of faithfulness, grammaticality and method of fusion for summary sentences.
- Findings
    - System outputs are more likely to be not factual compared to being ungrammatical.
    - Systems oftens simply concatenate rather than entity replacement while performing sentence fusion.
        - They are also generally more faithful.
    - Systems struggle to reliably perform complex fusion because they lead to incorrect facts.
        - System summary sentences formed by fusion also have low faithfulness compared to reference summaries.
- Different methods of fusion are 
    - Replacement (usually entity/pronoun)
    - Balanced concatenation (Similar length sentence fusion)
    - Imbalanced concatenation (Dissimilar length sentence fusion)
    - All other cases.
